Team7Project
============

This is Team 7's submission for the CMPUT301 Winter 2014 group project.

Application Description
============ 

The project is an Android application that allows for discussion of topics; these topics are bound to a 
place or GPS location, and would generally be about locally relevant things such as nearby restaurants 
and shops. Each topic is made up of comments, and both topic and comments can have a picture attached. 

All topics and comments can be replied to, and each reply can also have a picture attached as well. 
Users will also be able to favorite topics and comments, and be capable of commenting themselves using 
a username, and see other commenter's usernames. 

The application is very much like Reddit, but instead of subreddits, topics are grouped by geolocation.
