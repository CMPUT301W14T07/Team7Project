What I'm envisioning for our presentation is something like a business proposal to try and get a contract. I'm going to provide the basic list of what requirements were asked of us, and then show a video in each slide demoing the app fulfilling the bolded requirements in the top left. The numbers in green are just requirements shown previously in the presentation. Each slide will only show the bolded requirements, sticking to a kind of script. That way, whoever presents that slide will have a fairly clear idea of what they will need to prepare for (besides reviewing the video beforehand). The requirements aren't evenly split up mainly because I'm dividing each slide by time. Some features are fairly trivial (eg seeing commenter names), while others may take more time to set up (eg changing location and proving it by DDMS)
