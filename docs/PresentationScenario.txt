The user is out and about using our app which they have newly installed on their phone.

Scenario1:
User decides to start up the app. They must go through:
--login (User story #20)
--user will then see the threads. These threads have the comment authors (#21)
--by default, the user should see the newest threads (#16)
--the user will also be able to browse top level comments(#4)

Scenario2:
User now decides to participate.
--User creates a new top level comment (#3) and attach a photo (#7)
--the user posts from their current geolocation (#17)
--once the user has pushed the thread, it is shared and can be seen immediately (#14)
--oops! wanna edit (#13)

Scenario3:
The user wants to participate even more.
--User starts browsing other top level comments (#4 again), and enters a thread to see replies (#5)
--the user doesn't agree with someone and posts their own reply(#6)
--the user decides to favorite and cache two other top level comments(#10, #11)
--the user looks at the favorites, the cached, and the previously read threads through the fave 
button in the ActionBar (#10, 12)
--the user decides to tag, and search by that tag (exact match unfortunately) (#22)

Scenario4:
The user now wants to sort.
--User sorts by date, but no change (default behavior) (#9, #15, #16)
--User sorts by the pictures (#8)
--user sorts by proximity (#1)
--user sorts globally (shows all EXPANDED threads) (#19)

Scenario5:
Oh no, no internet.
--user can still see their favs, prev read and cached (#10, 12)
